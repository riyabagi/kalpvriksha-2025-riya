Kalpvriksha Program | Batch-2025: C Programming Assignments 
problem statement : Write a program to implement the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort a given array of integers in ascending order.

Bubble Sort Algorithm: Compare adjacent elements in the array.
                       Swap them if they are out of order.

Time Complexity:
Best Case (Already Sorted): 𝑂(𝑛)
Average Case: O(n^2)
Worst Case (Reverse Sorted): O(n^2)

Space Complexity:
𝑂(𝑛): as we don't require an extra space
